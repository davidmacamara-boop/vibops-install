# VibOps — Upgrade & Migration Runbook

_Last updated: 2026-05-05 · v0.15.0_

---

## Overview

This runbook covers upgrading a running VibOps instance, including Alembic schema migrations, rollback procedures, and handling breaking changes between versions. It complements `docs/installation.md` and the backup/restore procedures in `backup-restore.md`.

**Golden rule:** always take a database backup before upgrading. Migrations are hard to reverse.

---

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

- [ ] Read the CHANGELOG for the target version — note any **Breaking changes** or **Migration notes**
- [ ] Take a database backup (`make backup-now` or see `backup-restore.md`)
- [ ] Verify backup integrity (restore test to a scratch DB if possible)
- [ ] Check current migration head matches what is deployed:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec core alembic current
  ```
- [ ] Confirm no jobs are RUNNING or PENDING — drain the queue or plan for in-flight job cancellation
- [ ] Check available disk space — migrations can temporarily double index sizes:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- [ ] For Helm: ensure `my-values.yaml` is committed to version control

---

## 1. Docker Compose Upgrade

### Standard upgrade (no breaking changes)

```bash
# Pull new code
git pull

# Rebuild images
docker compose build

# Restart services (core applies migrations on startup)
docker compose up -d

# Tail logs to watch migration complete
docker compose logs -f core | grep -E "alembic|migration|ERROR"

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health | jq
```

### Upgrade with breaking schema change

If the CHANGELOG flags a breaking migration (e.g. column rename, constraint change):

```bash
# 1. Stop services except the database
docker compose stop core worker beat agent console

# 2. Take backup
make backup-now

# 3. Pull and build new images
git pull && docker compose build

# 4. Apply migration manually first (validate it runs cleanly)
docker compose run --rm core alembic upgrade heads

# 5. Check result
docker compose run --rm core alembic current

# 6. Bring services back up
docker compose up -d

# 7. Watch for startup errors
docker compose logs --tail=50 core worker
```

---

## 2. Helm Upgrade

### Standard upgrade

```bash
# Update chart index
helm repo update vibops

# Review diff before applying (requires helm-diff plugin)
helm diff upgrade vibops vibops/vibops -n vibops -f my-values.yaml

# Apply
helm upgrade vibops vibops/vibops \
  -n vibops \
  -f my-values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m

# Verify rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/vibops-core -n vibops
kubectl rollout status deployment/vibops-worker -n vibops
```

The `vibops-core` init container runs `alembic upgrade heads` before the pod starts. The old pod remains live until the new one passes its health check — zero-downtime for non-destructive migrations.

### Upgrade with breaking schema change

```bash
# 1. Scale workers to zero (stop job processing)
kubectl scale deployment vibops-worker --replicas=0 -n vibops
kubectl scale deployment vibops-beat --replicas=0 -n vibops

# 2. Take backup (run the backup job or snapshot the PV)
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/vibops-backup vibops-backup-preupgrade -n vibops

# 3. Apply new chart
helm upgrade vibops vibops/vibops \
  -n vibops \
  -f my-values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m

# 4. Restore worker replicas
kubectl scale deployment vibops-worker --replicas=2 -n vibops
kubectl scale deployment vibops-beat --replicas=1 -n vibops
```

---

## 3. Alembic Migration Reference

### Check current state

```bash
# Current revision in DB
docker compose exec core alembic current

# Full revision history
docker compose exec core alembic history --verbose

# Show pending (not yet applied) migrations
docker compose exec core alembic heads
```

### Apply manually

```bash
# Upgrade to latest
docker compose exec core alembic upgrade heads

# Upgrade to specific revision
docker compose exec core alembic upgrade <revision_id>

# Downgrade one step
docker compose exec core alembic downgrade -1

# Downgrade to specific revision
docker compose exec core alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

### Resolve revision collision

If `alembic upgrade heads` fails with "present more than once":

```bash
# Identify colliding revisions
docker compose exec core alembic history --verbose | grep "^Rev:"

# Check for duplicate revision IDs in alembic/versions/
grep -r "^revision = " core/alembic/versions/ | sort -k3
```

Fix: rename the newer file with a unique 12-char hex ID and update its `revision` and `down_revision` fields. Then re-run `alembic upgrade heads`.

---

## 4. Rollback Procedures

### Alembic downgrade (schema only)

Downgrades only reverse the schema — they do NOT restore data deleted or transformed by the migration. Always restore from backup when data is at risk.

```bash
# Downgrade one step
docker compose exec core alembic downgrade -1

# Downgrade to pre-upgrade revision (replace with actual ID)
docker compose exec core alembic downgrade <previous_head>

# Restart services after downgrade
docker compose restart core worker beat
```

### Full rollback (code + schema)

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Restore database from backup (see backup-restore.md)
make restore BACKUP_FILE=vibops-backup-YYYYMMDD.sql.gz

# Check out the previous version
git checkout v0.14.0    # replace with previous tag

# Rebuild
docker compose build

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

### Helm rollback

```bash
# List release history
helm history vibops -n vibops

# Roll back to previous revision
helm rollback vibops -n vibops

# Roll back to specific revision
helm rollback vibops <REVISION> -n vibops

# If DB schema was changed: also run alembic downgrade in the core pod
kubectl exec -it deploy/vibops-core -n vibops -- alembic downgrade -1
```

## 5. Breaking Changes by Version

### v0.15.x

- **`Job.gateway_id` is VARCHAR** — internal code that compared against a Python `UUID` object required `str(gw.id)`. No action needed on upgrade; DB column unchanged.
- **Alembic revision `j6k7l8m9n0o1`** — adds composite indexes on `jobs`, `audit_logs`, `memories`. Safe to apply hot; index creation does not lock reads on PostgreSQL 14+.

### v0.14.x

- No breaking schema changes.

### v0.13.x → v0.14.x

- `Organization` gained a self-referential `parent_org_id` FK (Tier 3 reselling, ADR 0013). Migration is additive and nullable — no data migration required.

## 6. Post-Upgrade Checklist

- [ ] `GET /api/v1/health` returns 200 with `worker.status: "online"`
- [ ] `alembic current` matches `alembic heads` (no pending migrations)
- [ ] Run smoke test: submit a simple job and verify it completes
- [ ] Check Grafana API SLO dashboard — no error spike
- [ ] Confirm gateway heartbeat: `GET /api/v1/gateways` shows `online: true` and recent `last_ping_at`
- [ ] Check audit log for unexpected errors: `GET /api/v1/audit?limit=20`
- [ ] Update `docs/STATUS.md` with new version and date
- [ ] Tag the git commit: `git tag v0.X.Y && git push origin v0.X.Y`
